        A "Class" literally just stores things. It by itself does not do anything.

        In the case of Antistasi, most of the scripts will grab all classes from the corresponding configs.

        Say we have a function that grabs all factions and displays their name. These classes exist as storage and key-value pairs basically.

    /*
        Vanilla_Base is a class in the main Antistasi Ultimate mod. It contains values for factions and such.
        https://github.com/SilenceIsFatto/A3-Antistasi-Ultimate/blob/stable/A3A/addons/core/Templates/Templates.hpp#L61-L69

        Class inheritance is a very useful thing and allows you to not have to re-define values in every class. Read more here:
        https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Class_Inheritance
    */

    /*
        Here we are creating a completely new class that inherits from Vanilla_Base (Link in the top comment above)

        Since it has a unique classname, this will show up as a new faction in the faction selector rather than overwriting an existing one.

        You do not need all of these values. If they are in the Vanilla_Base class, they will be inherited. Only define a value if you need to change it.
